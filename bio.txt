I am a former University student that did not make the best decision with the opportunity I was given. Luckily I found the YearUp program and am now able to pursue my dreams of becoming a software developer. In the words of Henry Ford "Failure is the opportunity to do things again, this time more intelligently." that is what I now live by. I will accomplish all my goals no matter what obstacle is in front of me.
As an emerging software developer with experience using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and GitHub. A few words to describe me would be passionate, determined, driven, empathetic, and motivating. I believe that we are all lifelong learners and can always improve. I take that mindset and apply everything I do. 
I have furure hopes of securing a full time position as a QA Analysts. I will continue to strive for the best and holding myself to be a life long learner. I feel that I can always find room for improvement.
